# BayesianMechanisticModeling

## Luis M. Lomeli

This repository contains a tutorial on fitting differential equations models using R and [STAN](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) as our preferred Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler.

The intended audience is graduate students in the biological and physical sciences that are starting their own research in topics that include Bayesian learning for mechanistic models.

Contents:

- Bayesian linear regression

- Logistic differential equation

- Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model

- Non-linear mixed effects (NLME) model
